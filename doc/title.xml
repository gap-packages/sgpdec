<TitleComment>
Hierarchical composition and decomposition of finite permutation groups and
transformation semigroups.
</TitleComment>

<Abstract>
This  &GAP; <Package>4.8</Package> package contains computational implementations
of coordinatizations, i.e. hierarchical decompositions of transformation
semigroups (Krohn-Rhodes theory) and permutation groups. Cascade products
(substructures of the wreath product) can be constructed by explicitly giving
the dependency functions between the components or can be obtained by the
decomposition algorithms (holonomy for semigroups and Lagrange-Frobenius
decomposition for groups).
